## Non-Technical Overview
This project is a simplified front end clone of music player app. It was created with React, firebase (for hosting and authentication).
#### Core Features
* Login, logout and create a new account. 
* Access to the list of songs/albums.

## Technical Overview

I focused on the following considerations: 
1. Design elegant UX without having a designer by leveraging open source UI libraries
2. Adhered to React and ES6 best practices to generate a true single page reactive web app experience.
3. Controlled access to paid content by syncing subscriptions with Firebase Authentication.
4. Validated Sign Up form
### Bonus features
1. Search for song/ artist/ album;
2. Add albums to favorite list;
